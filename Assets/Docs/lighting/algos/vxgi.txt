Types
	SVOGI -> VXGI
		Sparse voxel octree global illumination
		Rays are traced through voxels and shadow maps to gather occlusion and in-directional lighting.

Features
	Multi-boune GI using temporal feedback loop


Steps
	Voxelization of scene to get voxel depth
	Render geometry and get color.  Render to volume and downsample.
	Tracing diffuse and specular
