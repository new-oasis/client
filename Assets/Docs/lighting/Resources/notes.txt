AN EVALUATION OF REAL-TIME GLOBAL ILLUMINATION TECHNIQUES.pdf

Voxel Cone Tracer

In the field of computer graphics, realistic illumination has always been a major hurdle. Cal- culating the direct illumination caused on an object in the immediate view of a light source is no longer a problem; the same can however not be said about indirect illumination.


Methods
	Ray-tracing
		rays from camera
	Photon mappping
		rays from light source



Cones
	ray including spread angle and virtual origin information.
	Allows for better anti-aliasing, calculating fuzzy shadows and dull reflections, and calculating lods, and faster intersections.



Voxel Cone Tracer
	Combination of cone tracing and voxels.
	Discretizes scenes geometry using voxels.
	This is followed by three steps during which the lighting is computed based on this discretized representation of the scene.
	Problems due to approximation
		Light leaking, caused by the geometry simplification
		color banding, caused by the sampling steps of the voxel structure during cone tracing.
