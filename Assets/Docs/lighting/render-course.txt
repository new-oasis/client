BSDF Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function
	BRDF = Bidirectional _Reflectance_ Distribution Function
	BTDF = Bidirectional _Transmittance_ Distribution Function




Light
	Radiant flux = W|jules emitted
	irradiance = W/m2  (unit area)
	radiance = W/(m2*steradians)    (steradians = solid angle)
	Use Maxwell Equations which explain how waves behave

Math Basics
	Radians
		Alternative angle measurement
		Rotate counter clockwise
	Trig
		Angles in right angle triangle. soh cah toa
		sine = opposite over hypotenuse (edge opposite right angle)
		cosine = adjacent over hypotenuse
		tan = opposite over adjacent
