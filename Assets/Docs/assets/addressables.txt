Catalog
	Maps where and how to load
	Download modified catalog
	Enable 'Build Remote Catalog' on the main AddressableAssetSettings object.
	Catalog will be built-to and loaded-from the specified paths that cannot change.
	The content update process creates a new version of the catalog (with the same file name) to overwrite the file at the previously specified load path.

	When you build a Player, a unique Player content version string is generated.
	This version is used to identify which content catalog each player should load.
	Thus a given server can contain catalogs of multiple versions of your app without conflict.
	The version string, along with hash information for each asset that is in a group marked as StaticContent, is stored in the addressables_content_state.bin file.
	By default, this file is stored in the same folder as your AddressableAssetSettings.asset file.

	The addressables_content_state.bin file contains hash and dependency information for every StaticContent asset group in the Addressables system.
	All groups buliding to the streaming assets folder should be marked as StaticContent, though remote groups that are large may also benefit from this designation.
	During the Prepare for Content Update step, this hash information is used to determine if any StaticContent groups contain changed asses, and thus need those assets moved elsewhere.
